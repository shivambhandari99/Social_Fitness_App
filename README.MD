# Let’s Get Fit

# By: Shivam Bhandari, Fadi Abuhaltam, Jacob Diethert, Jordyn Ojeda, Daniel Song, and Peter DeVries.

# Introduction
Need

In the US\, 3 in 4 adults and 4 in 5 high school students do not meet the recommended “physical activity guidelines”\.

Approximately 31 million aged 50 or older do not perform any exercises\.

This induces health conditions such “heart diseases\, type 2 diabetes\, cancer\, and obesity”\. The annual health costs of such conditions are estimated at $117 billion\.

\(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\, 2019\)

# Goal

Goal of the formative study is to identify the causes of lack of exercise\.

# Formative Research Methods
Approach

  * Grounded Theory \(Strauss & Corbin\, 2014\)
  * Inductive approach \(Thomas\, 2006\)

Purposive sampling to identify the potential participants\.

# Formative Research MethodsParticipants

Six diverse participants aged 21 to 34 were recruited\.

Findings & Conclusion

<span style="color:#000000">Theme \#1: People like cardio\, or fitting workouts into normal daily activities\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Theme \#2: People are failing to meet their own goals\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Theme \#3: Getting help making a routine would be nice\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Theme \#4: Struggling to find time to fit in workouts\.</span>

<span style="color:#000000">Theme \#5: People who don’t already have equipment don’t want to make the investment\.</span>

# Summative & Formative User Testing
Goals

_Formative_  __: __

Identifying common usability issues\.

Identifying the potential usefulness of the app\.

_Summative_  __: __

Measuring user satisfaction\.

For future testing\, measuring the time it takes to complete tasks\.

__Purposive sampling to identify the potential participants\.__

# User Testing
Participants

Twelve diverse participants aged 21 to 34 were recruited\.

# User Testing
Approach

  * Grounded Theory \(Strauss & Corbin\, 2014\)
  * Inductive approach \(Thomas\, 2006\)
  * Data Driven Approach

# User Testing
Data Collection

The researcher introduced himself\, gathered consent\, and described the goals of the study\.

The participant conducted two tasks with the app\, and their times were measured\.

The participant were inquired on how the system worked and if they liked the app by using System Usability Scale \(SUS\) questions\.

The participant were inquired for general feedback on the app\.

# Summative Data Findings
Quantitative Analysis Findings

_Boxplot for time taken to complete Task 1_ :

_System Usability Scale:_

\(answers recorded from 1 to 5\, then converted and rescaled to 100\)

M = 86\.5\, SD = 16\.84

Considered “above average” based on SUS Scale\. \(GSA\, 2021\)

_Tasks  Duration_  __:__

Task 1: Leave a Comment :

M = 54 sec\, SD = 17 sec

Task 2: Create a Workout :

M = 53 sec\, SD = 15 sec

# Summative Quantitative Analysis
SUS Questions

![](img/Milestone%203%20Presentation%202-14.png)

| SUS Questions: | Mean | SD |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| I think that I would like to use this system frequently? | 3.83 | 0.94 |
| I found the system unnecessarily complex? (Flipped) | 4.33 | 0.98 |
| I thought the system was easy to use? | 4.17 | 0.83 |
| I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system? (Flipped) | 4.75 | 0.62 |
| I found the various functions in this system were well integrated? | 4 | 0.74 |
| I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system? (Flipped) | 4.33 | 0.98 |
| I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly? | 4.58 | 0.67 |
| I found the system very cumbersome to use? (Flipped) | 4.33 | 0.98 |
| I felt very confident using the system? | 4.25 | 0.87 |
| I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system? (Flipped) | 4.67 | 0.49 |

Note: the “negative” scores were converted into positive ones and vice versa\, so that a higher score means a better result for all questions\.

# Formative Qualitative Analysis
Errors reported during testing

Many subjects wrote down the workout title in the wrong section on the Create Workout page\.

A few subjects clicked the comment box instead of clicking the add comment button to try and add a comment\.

A few subjects had trouble finding the log workout button\.

Formative Qualitative Analysis

__Clustering of Open\-ended Questions Response__

![](img/Milestone%203%20Presentation%202-16.png)

Theme 1\, the app is simple to use\, and generally works how you would expect it to\.

Theme 2\, create a workout page is confusing\.

Theme 3\,additional social features are needed\.

Theme 4\, the app visual design needs polishing\.

Theme 5\, the app may reach those who already don’t workout to start working out solely through our app\.

# Needed Future Improvements

Creating a Workout

Improve text size to make it bigger\.

Differentiate the hierarchy of the text\.

![](img/Milestone%203%20Presentation%202-17.png)

Make it clearer where the workout and exercise titles should go\.

Make the comment box editable\, get rid of clicking an extra button\.

Add a scrollable option to add the rep count\.

Add a scrollable option that has a list of common workouts\.
